## WebGL Context Error Fix

### Problem
The canvas already had a 2D rendering context from the game/stick figure rendering. Browsers don't allow switching from 2D to WebGL context on the same canvas element, causing "Error creating WebGL context" errors.

### Solution: Dedicated 3D Canvas
Created a separate WebGL canvas that gets dynamically created and positioned over the 2D canvas when switching to 3D mode.

### Implementation Details

**Canvas Management**:
- `canvasElement`: Original 2D canvas for games/stick figure
- `webglCanvas`: Separate canvas created for 3D mannequin rendering
- Both canvases are positioned absolutely in the same container

**Mode Switching Logic**:
- **2D Mode**: Show `canvasElement`, hide `webglCanvas`
- **3D Mode**: Hide `canvasElement`, show `webglCanvas`
- Clean context separation prevents conflicts

**Key Changes**:
1. **Dynamic Canvas Creation**: WebGL canvas created only when needed
2. **Proper Canvas Switching**: Show/hide appropriate canvas for each mode
3. **Context Isolation**: Each canvas maintains its own context
4. **Proper Cleanup**: WebGL canvas removed when not needed

### Benefits
- ✅ No more WebGL context errors
- ✅ Clean separation of 2D and 3D rendering
- ✅ Proper resource management
- ✅ Maintains layout integrity
- ✅ Canvas mirroring preserved for both modes

### Current Status
- Build successful
- WebGL context creation isolated
- Mode switching implemented
- Ready for testing with mannequin rendering
